# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
![Flake8 Status](https://github.com/Vatsal-Malaviya/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

## Overview
This project is dedicated to performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The goal is to understand the sentiments expressed in tweets using advanced neural network architectures, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU).

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis?resource=download). It contains a comprehensive collection of tweets with associated sentiment labels, ideal for training and evaluating our models.

## Project Status
Currently, the project is in its initial stages. We are in the process of setting up the basic structure and exploring the dataset. Model development and training will follow as we progress.

## Models
We plan to experiment with various neural network architectures for this sentiment analysis task:

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** To capture the sequential nature of text data in tweets.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:** To address the issue of long-term dependencies in language data.
- **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU):** A variation of LSTM to efficiently model the temporal dependencies in text.

## Getting Started
Instructions for setting up the project will be provided soon.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to this project! Whether it's improving the code, suggesting new features, or reporting issues, feel free to reach out.
